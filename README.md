## About This Repository

I created this repository to store all my assignments for my current class. 
It will serve as a portfolio of my progress, my learning, and the practical work I’ve completed throughout the course.

 ## About  Me
 
I’m from the Democratic Republic of Congo 🇨🇩.
French is my native language, and I’m continuously improving my English to reach full fluency.
I joined this program at a time when I wasn’t sure which career path to follow but, today, I know where I’m heading, and I’m fully committed to getting there.
I’m still learning to enjoy coding, but I feel motivated when I build something useful and see it working as expected.

##  Why I'm Taking This Program

I'm taking this program because I want to build a solid foundation in coding.  
After completing this program, I plan to study cybersecurity at university, and, my end goal is to build a career in that field.  
This course is a first step toward becoming a skilled and responsible tech professional.💪🏽
